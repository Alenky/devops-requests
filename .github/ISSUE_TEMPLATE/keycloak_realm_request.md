## Step 0
**Are you the product owner or project admin/team lead?**
If not, you will need to ask one of those two people to make this request for you. We can't process realm requests except from individuals in these roles.

**Do you have an IDIR account?**
We use IDIR authentication for realm admin users, so you *must* have one in order to become a realm admin.  

## Step 1
Login to each the following links using your IDIR credentials. You will and see a the "_Forbidden_" message, but this is expected behaviour and will actually create your initial account on KeyCloak.
