## Step 0

**Are you a member of the private BCGOV GitHub Organization already?**
Please note that **new users may not request access for themselves**. If you are not a member already, please talk to whoever that performed the onboarding/introduction of the BCGov DevOps Platform and BCDevExchange, and ask that contact to create this request for you.

**Are you sure you need to have your project code close-sourced?**
We highly recommend open source, secrets and any sensitive information should never be part of your code based. If you still think your code needs to be private, please provide the details in the request.


## Step 1
Make sure no duplicated request exists, search here:
https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests/issues


## Step 2
Are you requesting to:
- [x] Create a private repo
- [ ] Remove a private repo and go public


## Step 3
Fill out the following fields

* Project Name: 
* GitHub Org: bcgov or private
* Details on choosing private repo: 
* GitHub ID for repo owner: @
* GitHub Account 2FA Confirmed: yes or no
* Email address: 
* Organization: 
* Project Role: 
* GitHub Team to Join (if exists): 


**Note** that the platform services team will be removing GitHub Org access for users that are not active for six months. Once the access has been removed, a new `Access Request` has to be made by the product owner.
