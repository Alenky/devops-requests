name: Request for adding or removing OpenShift access
about: To grant/remove OpenShift access for a user.

---
## Step 0
**Are you the product owner or project admin?**
If not, you will need to ask one of those two people to make this request for you. We can't process requests from individuals to have themselves granted access.

**Do you have a GitHub account?**
If not, create one, setup your name and associate it with your business email address.

**Do you have 2-factor-authentication enabled with your GitHub account?**
If not, configure that first.


## Step 1
Are you requesting to:
- [x] grant user access
- [ ] remove user access


## Step 2
Fill out the following fields

* Full Name: 
* GitHub ID: @
* Business Email Address: 
* Organization: 
* Project Role: 
* OpenShift Projects/Namespaces: 
<!--- For example: xyz123-tools, xyz123-dev, xyz123-test, xyz123-prod --->


**Note** that the platform services team will be removing OpenShift project access for users that are not active for six months. Once the access has been removed, a new `Access Request` has to be made by the product owner.
