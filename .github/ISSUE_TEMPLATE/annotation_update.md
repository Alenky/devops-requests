## Step 0
**Are you making this request for OCP4?**
In OCP4, you can now make this change yourself with our [Project Registry](https://registry.developer.gov.bc.ca/) tool! 
Just click the link and login. If you submit a request here for an OCP4 namespace, please note that it will be closed without action.

**Are you the product owner or technical lead?**
If not, you will need to ask one of those two people to make this request. 
If you're looking to update the product owner or technical lead information, the person *currently* listed as product owner or technical lead needs to make this request, rather than the new person.


## Step 1
Make sure no duplicated request exists, search here:
https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests/issues


## Step 2
What annotations/labels need to be changed? (Select all that apply)
- [ ] Product Owner
- [ ] Technical Steward
- [ ] Security Contacts
- [ ] Other Critical Contacts (contact info for other stakeholders such as members of IMB, Architecture, Privacy, etc groups that are interested in receiving comms related to this project sets.
- [ ] Product Group (an optional label that can be used to group together OpenShift Project Sets that share a business function (e.g. Platform Services project sets are labeled as part of "Platform Services" product group.  The value for this label should be determined by the organization/ministry/branch/team that owns the Project Set)

## Step 4
Submit this ticket and email us the contact information. 
Include the whole thing, but only fill out those sections pertaining the annotation you want updated.
**Fill out the entire section. If you skip a field, we will not action the ticket.**
