name: Request for BCGOV GitHub Organization Membership
about: To grant or remove access for a team member to BCGOV GitHub repositories.

## Step 0

**Do you already have a BCGOV GitHub Repository for your project?**
If not, make a request for the repo beofre making this request.

**Do you actually need the team member to be a member of the organization?**
- Often, it works just fine to have a team member as a Collaborator on your repository, without them being a member of the `bcgov` GitHub organization. Before submitting this request, consider whether you could simply invite your team member to contribute as a Collaborator.  
  Instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).

**Are you the admin of your project's BCGOV GitHub Repository?**
If not, you need to ask your project repo's admin to make this request.


## Step 1
Visit DevHub for detailed instruction on creating a request:
https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Getting-Started-on-the-DevOps-Platform/How-to-request-new-GitHub-user-access-or-repository-creation

## Step 2
Make sure no duplicated request exists, search here:
https://github.com/bcgov/devops-requests/issues


## Step 4
Are you requesting to:
- [x] Invite a user
- [ ] Remove a user


## Step 5
Fill out the following fields

* Project Name: 
* GitHub Org: bcgov or private
* Full Name: 
* GitHub ID: 
* GitHub Account 2FA Confirmed:
* Email address: 
* Organization:
